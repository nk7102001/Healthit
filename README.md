# Healthit – Full Stack Health & Fitness Web Application

Healthit is a full-stack health and fitness management web application
built using the MERN stack. The project focuses on BMI tracking,
AI-powered diet and workout planning, and secure user authentication
with role-based access control.  
It is designed to simulate a real-world, production-style application.
